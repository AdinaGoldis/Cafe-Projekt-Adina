            <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
            <p>I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding to give up my 9 to 5
                job in the city.
                With no catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business was NOT to look at it as a
                business. I
                treated it like my home and all the customers were guests in my home.
            </p>
            <p>After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not yet learnt the art of the business but
                have mastered
                the art of being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food I serve to my family at
                home. Everything is
                freshly cooked on site and served immediately to our guests.
